# Venture Plan

A React web application built with Bun, Vite, and TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (latest version)

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
make install
# or
bun install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
make dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Build

Build the production bundle:

```bash
make build
# or
bun run build
```

### Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
make preview
# or
bun run preview
```

## Deployment

This project is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `master` branch.

### Setting Up GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to Pages (under "Code and automation")
3. Under "Build and deployment", set Source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Push to the `master` branch to trigger deployment

The site will be available at: `https://<username>.github.io/ui-skeleton/`

## Renaming the Project

To rename this project to your own repository name:

```bash
make rename
```

This will:
1. Prompt you for the new repository name (e.g., `my-app`)
2. Update all references in the codebase
3. Convert the name to Title Case for display (e.g., "My App")
4. Reinstall dependencies with the new name

After renaming, review the changes with `git diff` and commit them.

## Makefile Targets

- `make build` - Build production bundle
- `make preview` - Preview production build
- `make install` - Install dependencies
- `make clean` - Remove node_modules and dist directories
- `make rename` - Rename the project (interactive)
